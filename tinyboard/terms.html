  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Last updated: January 30, 2026</p>

  <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of TinyBoard NYC ("the App"), developed by Danny Hertz. By using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

  <h2>Use of the App</h2>
  <p>TinyBoard provides real-time transit information for New York City transit systems. The App is provided "as is" for informational purposes. Transit data is sourced from the MTA and other transit agencies and may not always be accurate or available.</p>

  <h2>Transit Data Accuracy</h2>
  <p>TinyBoard displays data from third-party transit providers. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of transit information. Always use your own judgment when making travel decisions. Do not rely solely on the App for safety-critical transit decisions.</p>

  <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>TinyBoard offers optional paid subscriptions ("TinyBoard Pro") that unlock additional features. Subscriptions are billed through the Apple App Store.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
    <li>Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
    <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the rate of your selected plan.</li>
    <li>You can manage and cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings.</li>
    <li>Any unused portion of a free trial period is forfeited when you purchase a subscription.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Refunds</h2>
  <p>All purchases are processed by Apple. To request a refund, contact Apple Support or use the "Report a Problem" feature in your purchase history.</p>

  <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The App, its design, and original content are the property of Danny Hertz. MTA, Citi Bike, and other transit-related trademarks belong to their respective owners.</p>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Danny Hertz shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to missed transit connections, inaccurate arrival times, or service disruptions.</p>

  <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about these Terms, contact us at <a href="mailto:me@dannyhertz.com">me@dannyhertz.com</a>.</p>
