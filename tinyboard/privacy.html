  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Last updated: January 30, 2026</p>

  <p>TinyBoard NYC ("the App") is developed by Danny Hertz. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

  <h2>The Short Version</h2>
  <p>TinyBoard is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your transit data stays on your device. We do not have user accounts, we do not run ads, and we do not sell your data.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <h2>Location Data</h2>
  <p>The App requests access to your device location solely to show nearby transit stops and stations. Your location is sent directly to transit data providers (MTA, Citi Bike) to fetch relevant results. Your location is never stored on our servers or shared with third parties for advertising or analytics purposes.</p>

  <h2>Crash and Performance Data</h2>
  <p>We use Sentry for crash reporting. When the App encounters an error, anonymous diagnostic data (device model, OS version, stack trace) is sent to Sentry to help us fix bugs. This data is not linked to your identity.</p>

  <h2>Purchase Information</h2>
  <p>If you subscribe to TinyBoard Pro, your purchase is processed by Apple through the App Store. We use RevenueCat to manage subscription status. RevenueCat receives an anonymous identifier to track your subscription — no personal information is shared. We do not have access to your payment details.</p>

  <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
  <p>Your saved stops, preferences, and settings are stored locally on your device and synced via iCloud if you have it enabled. We do not have access to this data.</p>

  <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect your name, email, or any personal identifiers</li>
    <li>We do not use advertising identifiers or tracking frameworks</li>
    <li>We do not use analytics SDKs that track your behavior</li>
    <li>We do not create user profiles</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority)</strong> — Transit data provider. Your location is sent to their API to retrieve nearby stops and real-time arrivals.</li>
    <li><strong>Sentry</strong> — Crash reporting. Receives anonymous diagnostic data only.</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — Subscription management. Receives an anonymous app user ID only.</li>
    <li><strong>Apple (iCloud/CloudKit)</strong> — Syncs your saved stops across devices if iCloud is enabled.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The App does not require an account and collects no personal information.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
